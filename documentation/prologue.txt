As I said, I don't want to present him being all careless
'cause in fact he is not, I think

He seemed somewhat responsible, I think
It's gonna be hard to take this aspect away from him
Since it was clearly shown in various cases
But I still wanna make him unenthusiastic about stuff he's not already interested in
So he might get a hang of something new if presented from the right side, but he will resist trying it out in the first place
Generally the guy feels like a fulfilled person, satisfied with what he's got and simply enjoying his school life
We also might think on the background of this character? How come he is what he is?
